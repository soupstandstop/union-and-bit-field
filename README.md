# union-and-bit-field
# 1. Write a program that can input a float or double number and print
out its bit pattern and vice versa (input 32 bits for float or 64 bits
for double pattern and output its value).
Note: you should use the three techniques mentioned in the class:
(a) an integer pointer to float or double,
(b) union, and
(c) bit field
# 2. Please check:
1. Is it correct that the value,
1.1754943508222875079687365372222456778186655567720
87521508751706278417259454727172851560500000000000
000000000000000000000e-38f ,
is the smallest floating point number as stated in the textbook. If
not, what is the smallest floating point number ?
2. What is the bit pattern of f=0.0
